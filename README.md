# Auth Playground

**Auth Playground** is a playground 🎮 to help you to get all authentication codes and tokens during development 🧑‍💻. We do not save any token or code which you received to be sure about that 🔐, you can check 👁 our opensource Github Repository 📖. You are also welcome to contribute to this project.

## Contribution

We would love ❤️ if you contribute 🧑‍💻 to this project. You can for example add a new authentication provider 🏢, fix some issues 🔴 which you found or do something else.
